# Technical Documentation Page

This technical documentation page is modeled after the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Technical Documentation Page Certification Project. This technical documentation page covers key HTML concepts and serves as a reference guide. It is based on Dave Gray's "HTML for Beginners" Full Course, with MDN Docs serving as the major resource. This website was designed using HTML and CSS best practices, including Semantic HTML tags, proper CSS Selectors, Typography, and Responsive Web Design.

## Introduction

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It defines the structure and content of a webpage using tags and elements.

## HTML Basics

- Understanding the DOCTYPE declaration
- Creating an HTML document with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`
- Adding metadata with `<meta>` tags

## HTML Elements

- Commonly used elements: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, etc.
- Inline vs. block-level elements
- Nesting elements

## Document Structure

- Organizing content with headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
- Creating paragraphs and line breaks
- Using comments (`<!-- ... -->`) for clarity

## Semantic HTML

- Importance of semantic tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`)
- Enhancing accessibility with semantic elements

## Forms

- Building forms with `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, and other form elements
- Handling user input and validation

## Tables

- Creating tables using `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>`
- Adding captions and headers

## Images and Multimedia

- Embedding images with `<img>`
- Including audio and video content

## Links and Navigation

- Creating hyperlinks with `<a>`
- Navigating within the same page using anchor links (`<a href="#section-id">`)

## Best Practices

- Validating HTML using W3C validators
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Using semantic elements appropriately
