## Introduction

Welcome to our technical documentation page! Here, you'll find detailed explanations and examples related to web development using HTML and CSS. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide will help you enhance your skills.

## HTML Basics

### Semantic HTML Tags

Semantic HTML tags provide meaning to the structure of your web content. Some important tags include:

- `<header>`: Represents the header section of a webpage.
- `<nav>`: Defines navigation links.
- `<main>`: Contains the main content of the page.
- `<section>`: Represents a thematic grouping of content.
- `<article>`: Contains independent, self-contained content.

## CSS Essentials

### CSS Selectors

CSS selectors allow you to target specific HTML elements for styling. Common selectors include:

- `element`: Selects all instances of a specific HTML element.
- `.class`: Targets elements with a specific class.
- `#id`: Selects an element with a specific ID.

### Typography

Learn how to style text using CSS properties such as `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `line-height`. Good typography enhances readability and user experience.

## Responsive Design

### Media Queries

Create responsive layouts using media queries. Adjust your styles based on screen size, ensuring your website looks great on various devices.

## Custom Variables

### CSS Variables (Custom Properties)

Define reusable values using custom variables. These variables can be used throughout your CSS to maintain consistency and make updates easier.

## Organizing CSS

### File Structure

Organize your CSS files by creating separate files for different components. Use a consistent naming convention and directory structure.
