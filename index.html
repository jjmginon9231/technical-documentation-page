            <ul>
                <li>
                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the fundamental building component of the web. It describes the
                    meaning and organization of web content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The term "hypertext" refers to linkages that connect web pages together, either within or between
                    websites.
                </li>
                <li>
                    HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content that will be shown in a Web browser.
                    HTML markup comprises specific "elements" such as <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and many more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    HTML elements are distinguished from other text in a document by "tags" that include the element
                    name surrounded by "<code>&lt;</code>" and "<code>&gt;</code>". The name of an element inside a tag
                    is case insensitive. That
                    is, it can be written in capital, lowercase, or both. For instance, the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>
                    tag can be
                    typed as <code>&lt;Title&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;TITLE&gt;</code>, or any other variation. The
                    standard and suggested practice
                    is to write tags in lowercase.

                <h2>Head Tags</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                The Head section of an HTML document contains metadata about the document, such as the author,
                description, and links to CSS or JavaScript files that should be used with the HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                The head of an HTML document is the portion of the page that does not appear in the web browser when it
                is loaded. It provides information such as the page <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, links to CSS (if you
                choose to design
                your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and other metadata. Web browsers use the
                information in the head to accurately render the HTML document. In this post, we'll go over everything
                mentioned above and more to provide you with a solid foundation for working with markup.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element specifies the title of the HTML document, not its content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Metadata is data that describes data. The <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element is the "official" way to add
                metadat covered in this article could be considered metadata as well. There are several types of
                <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> components that can be included in your page's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, but
                we won't try to discuss them all here as it would be too confusing. Instead, we'll explain afew common
                items to give you an idea.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code> element provides the document's character encoding,
                    which
                    determines the character set it can use. utf-8 is a universal character set that contains almost
                    every character from each human language. This indicates that your web page will be able to display
                    any language; therefore, it is a good idea to include this option on every web page you make!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Many <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> elements have name and content properties. The name indicates the
                    type of meta
                    element and the sort of information it contains. Specifying an author using the name attribute is
                    important in a variety of reasons, including understanding who produced the page and contacting them
                    if you have any questions about the content. Some content management systems have the ability to
                    automatically extract page author information and make it available for these uses.Meanwhile,
                    content refers to the actual meta content. Using the content attribute to provide a description that
                    incorporates keywords related to the content of your website is beneficial since it has the
                    potential to have your page appear higher in relevant searches made in search engines (such actions
                    are known as Search Engine Optimization, or SEO).
                </li>
                <li>
                    To enhance your site design, you can include references to custom icons in your metadata, which will
                    be displayed in specific scenarios. The favicon (short for "favorites icon", referring to its use in
                    browser "favorites" or "bookmarks" lists) is the most ubiquitous of these.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Always place the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element in the document's head section. This accepts two
                attributes:
                rel="stylesheet", which indicates that it is the document's stylesheet, and href, which contains the
                path of the stylesheet file.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, it's worth noting that you can (and should) specify the language of your page. This can be
                accomplished by including the lang attribute with the beginning HTML tag.

                <h2>Text Basics</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                The HTML elements <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> through <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> represent six levels of
                section headings. <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is
                the highest section level, while <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> is the lowest. By default, all heading elements
                produce a
                block-level box in the layout, beginning on a new line and taking up the whole width of their contained
                block.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users of screen reading software frequently go from heading to heading to discover the page's content.
                Because of this, it is critical not to skip one or more heading levels. Doing so may cause confusion
                because the individual navigating this way may be left wondering where the missing heading is.
            </p>
            <p>
                Headings can be nested as subsections to better organize the page's content. Most screen readers can
                also provide an ordered list of all the headings on a page, helping a person rapidly determine the
                hierarchy of the material.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> HTML element denotes a paragraph. Paragraphs are typically portrayed in
                visual media as
                blocks of text separated from neighboring blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation; however,
                HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related material, such as photos or form fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> HTML element indicates a thematic break between paragraph-level components,
                such as a
                change of scene or topic within a section.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> HTML element creates a line break in text (carriage return). It is useful
                when composing
                a poem or an address with major line breaks.
            </p>
            <p>Block-level Element vs. Inline-level Element</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A block-level element always begins with a new line. In horizontal writing modes like as English or
                    Arabic, it takes up the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container) and a vertical
                    space equal to the height of its contents, resulting in a "block".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most text sequences, replacement elements, and created material are inline by default.

                    Inline layout divides a mixed stream of text, replacement elements, and other inline boxes into a
                    stack of line boxes. Within each line box, inline-level boxes are vertically or horizontally
                    aligned, depending on the writing style. They are often aligned by their text's baselines.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> HTML element shows text with stress intensity. The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>
                element can be nested, with
                each level expressing a higher degree of emphasis.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> HTML element conveys significant importance, seriousness, or urgency.
                Browsers often
                display the material in bold type.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some special characters are reserved for usage in HTML, so your browser will interpret them as HTML
                code. If you use the less-than (<code>&lt;</code>) sign, the browser interprets any text after it as a
                tag.

                To show these characters as text, replace them with the relevant character entities, such as
                <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>,
                <code>&amp;lt;</code>, <code>&amp;gt;</code>, <code>&amp;copy;</code>, and others.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> HTML element indicates an abbreviation or acronym. When using an
                abbreviation or
                acronym, include a complete extension of the phrase in plain text on the first use, along with the
                <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> tag to denote the abbreviation. This tells the user what an abbreviation or
                acronym
                implies. When the abbreviation or acronym does not have a full extension, the optional title attribute
                can supply one. This gives user agents a guideline on how to announce/display the information while also
                telling all users about the abbreviation. If present, the title must include this entire description and
                nothing else.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> HTML element indicates that the enclosing HTML contains contact
                information for a
                person, group, or organization. An <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> element can provide contact information
                in various
                formats, including physical addresses, URLs, email addresses, phone numbers, social media handles, and
                geographic coordinates, depending on the context. The <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> element should
                include the name of
                the person(s) or organization to which the contact information pertains.

                The Comment interface represents textual notations within markup; while not visually shown, such

                The <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> HTML element indicates an ordered list of objects, usually displayed as a

            <p>
                The <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> HTML element represents an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent

                as an ordered list (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>), an unordered list (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>), or a menu. In
                menus and unordered
                lists, list elements are typically shown using bullet points. Ordered lists are typically displayed with
                an ascending counter to the left, such as a number or letter.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> HTML element indicates an unordered list of items, usually shown as a

            <p>
                The <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> HTML element indicates a description list. The element contains a list of
                words
                (specified with the <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> element) and descriptions (supplied by
                <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> elements). This element
                is commonly used to implement a glossary or display metadata (a set of key-value pairs).

                    The <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> HTML element identifies a term in a description or definition list and
                    must be used
                    inside a <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> element. It is often followed by a <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> element;
                    however, numerous
                    <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> elements in a row indicate several terms that are all specified by the

                The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> HTML element (or anchor element) with its href attribute generates a
                hyperlink to web

                The content of each <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> should indicate the link's destination. If the href attribute

                Absolute references always start with the protocol name. An absolute reference is the whole address of a
                web page, as shown in the browser's address bar. Absolute references refer to another site on the
                Internet. Even if your website moves (for example, from your PC to a web server somewhere on the
                Internet), all absolute references will continue to work because they do not rely on the current page's
                position for information.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you have more than one page on your website, you employ relative references. Most websites are made
                up of interconnected web pages rather than single pages. When you have a series of interconnected pages,
                the relative reference comes in handy. There is no protocol or address at all, only a filename. Relative
                references function by assuming the address of the current page. When the user clicks, the browser sees
                no protocol and assumes that the html file is located in the same directory on the same server.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>id</code> attribute defines a unique identifier (ID) which must be unique in the whole
                document. Its
                function is to identify the element when linking (by a fragment identifier), scripting, or styling (via
                CSS).
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> HTML element is a portion of a page that provides navigation links, either
                within or to
                other documents. Menus, tables of contents, and indexes are common types of navigation sections.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>download</code> attribute tells the browser to treat the linked URL as a download.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>mailto:</code> scheme can be used to build links that open the user's email software and allow
                them to send
                a new message.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>tel</code> attribute connection behavior varies according to device capabilities:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Cellular devices will dial the number automatically.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most operating systems provide programs for making calls, such as Skype or FaceTime.
                </li>
                <li>
                    registerProtocolHandler allows websites to make phone calls, such as web.skype.com.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Other activities include adding the number to contacts or transferring it to another device.

            <p>
                Links that open in a new tab/window with <code>target="_blank"</code> or that point to a download file
                should specify

                The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> HTML element embeds an image in the content.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <code>src</code> attribute is required, and contains the path to the image you want to embed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>alt</code> attribute holds a textual replacement for the image, which is mandatory and
                    incredibly
                    useful for accessibility — screen readers read the attribute value out to their users so they know
                    what the image means. If the image cannot be loaded for any reason, such as network difficulties,
                    content blocking, or linkrot, alt text is displayed on the page instead.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To prevent content layout shifts, set the image's intrinsic size by using both <code>width</code>
                    and <code>height</code>
                    attributes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>alt</code> attribute defines text that can be used to substitute an image on a webpage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>loading</code> attribute specifies how the browser should load the image. The eager value
                    loads the
                    picture immediately, regardless of whether it is currently visible in the viewport (default value).
                    The lazy value delays loading the image until it reaches a calculated distance from the viewport, as
                    specified by the browser. The goal is to avoid using network and storage bandwidth to handle the
                    image until it is relatively likely that it will be required. This generally enhances the content's
                    performance in most common usage situations.

                The <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> HTML element indicates self-contained content, which may include an
                optional caption
                given with the <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> element. The figure, caption, and contents are all
                referenced as one
                unit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> HTML element adds a caption or legend to the
                <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element, making the
                content more accessible.

            <p>
                In HTML, for example, the <code>h1</code> element is a semantic element that assigns the text it wraps
                around the
                role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
            </p>
            <p>
                By default, most browsers' user agent stylesheets will style a h1 with a large font size to resemble a
                heading (but you can design it to appear like anything).
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, you can use <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> to make any element appear as a top level
                heading. This will
                make it look like a top-level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not receive any of the
                benefits indicated above. As a result, it is recommended that you use the appropriate HTML element for
                the task at hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></li>
                <li><code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></li>
                <li><code>&lt;details&gt;</code></li>
                <li><code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code></li>
                <li><code>&lt;figure&gt;</code></li>
                <li><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></li>
                <li><code>&lt;form&gt;</code></li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> HTML element represents introductory text, such as navigational aids. It
                may have
                certain heading components, as well as a logo, a search form, the author's name, and other things. It
                can define a global site header, often known as a banner in the accessibility tree. It typically
                comprises a logo, firm name, a search function, and potentially worldwide navigation or a motto. It is
                typically seen at the top of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> HTML element represents a document's primary material in the
                <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section. The
                primary content area includes content that is directly related to or expands on the central topic of a
                document or the central feature of an application. The content of the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element
                should be
                unique to the document. Sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms
                are examples of content that should not be provided unless the search form is the primary function of
                the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> HTML element creates a footer for the ancestor sectioning content or
                root element. A
                <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> often includes author information, copyright data, and links to relevant
                papers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> HTML element refers to a self-contained composition in a document,
                page,
                application, or site that can be independently distributed or reused (e.g., in syndication). A forum
                post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an
                interactive widget or gadget, or any other piece of content that stands alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> HTML element represents a general independent portion of a document
                without a
                specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few
                exceptions. Using <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> without a heading is more common in web application/UI
                sections than
                in traditional document structures. It makes no sense to have a separate part of material in a document
                if there is no heading to describe its contents. like headlines are beneficial to all readers, but
                especially to those who use assistive technologies like as screen readers, and they also help with SEO.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> HTML element denotes a section of a document whose content is only
                indirectly related
                to the main content. Asides are often presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> HTML element generates a disclosure widget that displays
                    information only when
                    toggled into the "open" state. To offer a summary or label, use the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>
                    element. A
                    disclosure widget is often displayed onscreen as a little triangle that spins (or twists) to
                    indicate open/closed status, along with a label next to it. The disclosure widget's label is based
                    on the contents of the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> element. The <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>
                    section provides an
                    understandable description for the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>.

                <li>
                    The <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> HTML element adds a summary, caption, or legend to a
                    <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element's
                    disclosure box. Clicking the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> element changes the state of the parent
                    <code>&lt;details&gt;</code>
                    element from open to closed.

                The <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> HTML element marks or highlights text for reference or notation based on
                its relevance
                in the context.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> HTML element denotes a certain time interval. It may have the datetime
                element, which
                converts dates into machine-readable format, allowing for improved search engine results or custom
                functionality like reminders.

                    The <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> HTML element contains a series of table rows (<code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>
                    elements), indicating
                    that they are the head of a table with information about the table's columns. Column headers
                    (<code>&lt;th&gt;</code> elements) are common examples of this. The <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> HTML
                    element contains a set of
                    table rows (<code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> components) that make up the core data of a table. The

                    <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;tfoot&gt;</code> components, contains useful semantic
                    information that can be used
                    when rendering for both screen and print. Specifying such table content categories also provides

                <li>
                    post: The POST method sends form data as the request body.
                </li>
                <li>
                    get (default): The GET form data is appended to the action URL with a ? separator. Use this method
                    when the form has no negative consequences.

                The <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> HTML element serves as a caption for an item in a user interface. To link
                a
                <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element to a <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element, add the id property to the
                <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element.
                Next, add the for attribute to the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element, with the same value as the id in
                the
                <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> HTML element creates interactive controls for web-based forms to accept
                user data.
                Various types of input data and control widgets are accessible, depending on the device and user agent.
                The <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element is one of the most powerful and complex in HTML due to the
                numerous
                combinations of input types and attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The functionality of a <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> differs based on its type property, hence each type is
                addressed in
                its own reference page. If this attribute is not given, the default type used is text. Some of the
                available types are listed below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>text</code>: The default value. A one-line text box. Line breaks are automatically removed
                    from the input
                    value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>password</code>: allows the user to safely input a password The element appears as a one-line
                    plain text
                    editor control with the text masked such that it cannot be read, typically by replacing each
                    character with a symbol like as an asterisk ("*") or a dot ("•"). This character will vary according
                    on the user agent and operating system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>tel</code>: a control for entering a phone number. In certain devices with dynamic keypads, a
                    telephone
                    keypad is displayed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>number</code>: a control for entering numbers. Displays a spinner and includes default
                    validation. In some
                    dynamic keypad-equipped gadgets, a numeric keypad is displayed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>radio</code>: are commonly used in radio groups, which are collections of radio buttons that
                    describe a
                    set of linked possibilities. Only one radio button from each group can be selected at the same time.
                    Radio buttons are often represented as little circles that are filled or highlighted when selected.
                    A radio group is defined by giving all of the radio buttons in the group the same name. When a radio
                    group is created, selecting any radio button in that group instantly deselects any other radio
                    buttons in the same group that are already chosen.
                    You can have as many radio groups on a page as you want, as long as each has its own distinct name.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>checkbox</code>: are shown by default as boxes that are checked (ticked) when engaged, similar
                    to what you
                    would see on an official government paper form. The actual appearance is determined by the operating
                    system configuration under which the browser is running. This is generally a square, however the
                    corners may be rounded. A checkbox allows you to choose individual values for submission in a form
                    (or not). The value attribute is a string that represents the value of the checkbox. This is not
                    visible on the client-side, but on the server, it is the value assigned to the data entered with the
                    checkbox name.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>email</code>: A field for entering an email address. It appears to be a text input, but it
                    includes
                    validation criteria and an appropriate keyboard to enable browsers and devices with dynamic
                    keyboards.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Notable Input Attributes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <code>placeholder</code> attribute is a string that gives the user a brief suggestion about what
                    type of
                    information is anticipated in the field. It should be a word or a short sentence that displays the
                    expected type of data, rather than an explanation. The text must not contain carriage returns or
                    line
                    feeds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>autocomplete</code> attribute accepts a space-separated text that specifies what type of
                    autocomplete
                    capabilities the input should give. A common implementation of autocomplete retrieves past values
                    typed
                    in the same input field; however, more advanced versions of autocomplete exist. For example, a
                    browser
                    may work with a device's contacts list to autocomplete email addresses in an email input field.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>required</code> attribute is a Boolean property that, when present, indicates that the
                    user must enter
                    a
                    value for the input before the form can be submitted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>autofocus</code> is a Boolean attribute that, if present, signals that the input should
                    automatically
                    have focus when the page has finished loading. Only one element in the document may contain the
                    autofocus attribute. If the attribute is applied to more than one element, the first element having
                    the attribute is given priority. The autofocus attribute cannot be used on <code>hidden</code>
                    inputs because
                    they cannot be focused. When using the autofocus attribute, take care to ensure accessibility.
                    Automatically focusing on a control can cause the page to scroll upon load. Some touch devices may
                    also show dynamic keyboards as a result of the emphasis. While a screen reader will announce the
                    label of the form control that has received focus, it will not declare anything prior to the label,
                    and a sighted user on a small device will also miss the context produced by the previous content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When the <code>pattern</code> attribute is given, the input's value must match the regular
                    expression in order to
                    pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as defined by the
                    <code>RegExp</code> type and documented in our regular expressions reference; when compiling the
                    regular
                    expression, the 'u' flag is supplied to treat the pattern as a series of Unicode code points rather
                    than ASCII. No forward slashes should be used around the pattern text. If the requested pattern is
                    not provided or is invalid, no regular expression is used, and this attribute is completely
                    disregarded.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>min</code> attribute specifies the minimal value that will be accepted for this input. If
                    the element's
                    value is less than this, it fails constraint validation. If min is specified as an invalid number,
                    the input has no minimum value. This value must be less than or equal to the value of the max
                    attribute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>max</code> attribute specifies the maximum value to accept for this input. If the value
                    entered into
                    the element exceeds this limit, it fails constraint validation. If the max attribute's value is not
                    a number, the element has no maximum value. This value must be greater than or equal to the value of
                    the min attribute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>step</code> attribute is a number that determines the level of granularity to which the
                    value must
                    comply, or any custom value, as defined below. Only values equivalent to the foundation for stepping
                    are valid.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> HTML element creates a control with a menu of options.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> HTML element specifies an item within a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>,
                    <code>&lt;optgroup&gt;</code>, or
                    <code>&lt;datalist&gt;</code> element. <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> can be used to represent menu
                    items in popups and lists in
                    HTML documents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>&lt;optgroup&gt;</code> HTML element groups choices within the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>
                    element.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Notable Select Attributes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <code>multiple</code> attribute, which is a Boolean, specifies that numerous alternatives from
                    the list can
                    be picked. If it is not mentioned, only one option may be chosen at a time. When numerous options
                    are supplied, most browsers display a scrolling list box rather than a single-line dropdown.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>size</code> attribute: If the control is displayed as a scrolling list box (for example,
                    when many is
                    supplied), this attribute indicates how many rows in the list should be seen at once. Browsers are
                    not needed to display a choose element as a scrollable list box. The default value is zero.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Notable Option Attributes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <code>value</code> attribute's content represents the value that will be sent with the form if
                    this option is
                    selected. If this attribute is absent, the value is taken from the option element's text content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>selected</code> attribute, which is a Boolean, indicates that the option is initially
                    selected. If the
                    <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> element is a descendant of a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element without
                    multiple attributes, only
                    one <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> of this <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element can have the selected
                    attribute.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Noteable Optgroup Attributes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <code>label</code> attribute specifies the name of the set of options that the browser can use
                    to label the
                    options in the user interface. This attribute is required if the element is utilized.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;datalist&gt;</code> HTML element has a set of <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> elements that
                reflect the permissible or
                recommended options to choose from within other controls. To bind the <code>&lt;datalist&gt;</code>
                element to the
                control, give it a unique identifier in the id attribute. Then, add the list attribute to the
                <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element with the same identification as value. This functionality is only
                supported by
                certain types of <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> and may vary between browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> element groups a section of an HTML form and is accompanied by a
                nested
                <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> element that serves as its caption. It accepts few attributes, the most
                important of
                which are form, which can contain the id of a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> on the same page, allowing you
                to make the
                <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> part of that <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> even if it is not nested inside it,
                and disabled, which
                allows you to deactivate the <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> and all its contents at once.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> HTML element provides a caption for the content of the parent
                    <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> HTML element is excellent for allowing users to enter large amounts of
                free-form
                text, such as comments on a review or feedback form. To improve accessibility, the
                <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> can
                be linked to a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element using an id property. The name attribute specifies the
                name of the
                associated data point that is sent to the server when the form is submitted. The rows and cols
                attributes allow you to select the exact size for the <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>. Setting these is a
                good idea for
                uniformity, as browser defaults vary.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> HTML element is an interactive element that a user can activate using a
                mouse,
                keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once engaged, it takes a certain action,
                such as submitting a form or starting a conversation.
            </p>
            <h3>Types of a Button for Forms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    submit: This button sends the form data to the server. This is the default if the property is not
                    supplied for buttons connected with a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, or if the value is empty or
                    invalid.
                </li>
                <li>
                    reset: The button resets all controls to their original values, such as
                    <code>&lt;input type="reset"&gt;</code>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Notable Attributes for Submit Button</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The formaction attribute contains the URL for processing the information submitted by the button.
                    This overrides the action attribute set by the button's form owner. However, it has no effect if the
                    form does not have an owner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the button is a submit button (connected with a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> and not
                    <code>type="button"</code>),
                    this
                    attribute defines the HTTP method used to submit the form.
